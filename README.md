## Installation of the C++ implementation

This implementation was tested on Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04.5 LTS) and Kylin (16.04.1 LTS). Install all required tools:
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
```
Cmake 3.2.2 or higher is required, so:
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/cmake-3.x
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
Then, check
```
cmake --version
``` 
In case of segmentation fault,
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
Then, check
```
cmake --version
```

### OpenCV and OpenCV_Contrib
```
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
mkdir opencv_build
cd opencv_build
cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../opencv_contrib/modules ../opencv
make -j5
sudo make install
```
To check the currently installed version of opencv:
```
pkg-config --modversion opencv
```

### SuiteSparse
To download the most recent version:
```
git clone https://github.com/jluttine/suitesparse.git
```
However, our implementation of Takahashi's inverse (spinv) needs UFconfig, this is found in [**SuiteSparse-3.7.1.tar.gz**](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/SuiteSparse/SuiteSparse-3.7.1.tar.gz). Also, need to install lapack, blas, openblas, metis, and parmetis (not really needed at the moment).
```
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libblas-dev libopenblas-dev libmetis-dev libparmetis-dev
cd SuiteSparse
```
Download [**metis-4.0.3**](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/metis/OLD/metis-4.0.3.tar.gz), and rename the folder to matis-4.0. In the Makefile.in, update the following:
```
CC = gcc
OPTFLAGS = -O3 
COPTIONS = -fPIC
```
Then;
```
make
sudo make install
```
### Eigen
Download and compile [**Eigen**](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.3-rc1.tar.bz2).
```
cd Eigen
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
sudo make install
```

### libboost
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### YARP Network and iCub
Our implementation uses [**YARP**](http://www.yarp.it/install.html) to replay data, implement multi-threading, and locate different resources. I personally install it from source. Also, if you are a fan of [**iCub**](http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/ICub_Software_Installation), you will find very useful tools and simulations. To run iCubSIM, you would need to install SDL, GLUT, ODE, IPOPT, and gfortran:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libode3 libode-dev coinor-libipopt-dev libgsl2 libgsl-dev
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gfortran -y
```
Additionally, for Ubuntu 16.04.01
```
sudo apt-get install aces3 libghc-glut-dev 
```
In addition to the installation instruction, if you like to install ICUB_SIM, then set:
```
ICUB_SHARED_LIBRARY = ON
```

### VLFeat
Download [**VLFeat 0.9.20 binary package**](http://www.vlfeat.org/download/vlfeat-0.9.20-bin.tar.gz)
```
run <VLFEATROOT>/toolbox/vl_setup
```
If compiling without MATLAB, in the makefile, comment out the line
```
#include make/matlab.mak. Then, "make".
```
To compile our code with VLFeat, in `.bash_aliases` or `.bashrc` write: 

```
export VLFEAT_ROOT=/path/to/vlfeat/directory
```

## Compiling MEX functions in MATLAB
If you are planning on using our mex wrappers, you need to download and install [**MATLAB**](https://au.mathworks.com/downloads/).
Update all the related paths in `compile_PwgOptimiser.m` and `compile_GraphOptimiser.m`, then;
```
run compile_PwgOptimiser;
run compile_GraphOptimiser;
```
This will compile and test against the MATLAB code (if this isn't needed, then comment out this comparison part).

## Installing the MATLAB code dependencies
The MATLAB code isn't yet available, but we will upload the code soon.
In order to run our MATLAB implementation, you would need to install [**GP-stuff**](http://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/software/gpstuff/) (we use their sparse inverse, if you have an alternative solution, then you may skip this step):
```
git clone https://github.com/gpstuff-dev/gpstuff
```
In MATLAB, navigate to the folder, then
```
run matlab_install('SuiteSparseOn')
```
There were two fixes. First, in `matlab_install.m`, replace `cd SuiteSparse` with `cd /your/path/to/suitesparse`. Second, in `SuiteSparse_install.m`, replace `function SuiteSparse_install(input)` with `function paths = SuiteSparse_install(input)`.

You would also need to install [**mexopencv**](http://vision.is.tohoku.ac.jp/~kyamagu/en/software/mexopencv/)
```
git clone https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv.git
cd mexopencv
DIR_MATLAB=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2016b
make all MATLABDIR=$DIR_MATLAB
```
## C++ Development tools
One example that runs on Ubuntu is [**Eclipse**](https://eclipse.org/downloads/). Notice that this requires to have [**JRE**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html), and optionally, [**JDK**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) downloaded.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install eclipse
sudo apt-get install eclipse eclipse-cdt
```

## Doxygen
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen doxygen-gui
```
run ```doxywizard``` or create a configuration file using ```doxygen -g /doxygen/doxygen.cfg```. To generate an ```index.html``` file in the main code folder, the easiest solution is probably to create a symbolic link or shortcut to the index.html file generated by doxygen, rather than trying to get doxygen to change the layout of it's output files. This symlink/shortcut can then be placed in the root directory of your project (or elsewhere), pointing to ```doxygen/html/index.html```, and named anything you like to make it obvious to your users what it is.
```
ln -s doxygen/html/index.html index.html
```
