The file "add.bundle" contains the scan alignment code written by Tim Bailey. This copy was sent by Peter Morton.

.bundle is also used by Git. If you have a Git bundle, use Git to checkout from the bundle. 
It is basically just a remote repository residing on your filesystem.

In a terminal: 
	git clone add.bundle

This will add a folder "add" into the folder where terminal is running.
