This contains MATLAB demonstrations for
  1- iCub@iit
  2- iCub@heidelberg
  3- R1@iit
	
The main function is batch_demo().

The folder contains toolboxes, where some of them are still under review:
  1- batch: is the batch optimisation (relative and global) toolbox.
  2- common: contains matlab utilities common in between all the tools.
  3- dense: contains dense disparity estimation functions.
  4- heicub: contains functions related to icub@heidelberg.
  5- icub: contains functions related to icub@iit.
  6- include: contains standard Mathworks headers (copyright of Mathworks).
  7- lmatch: contains line matching and lines bundle-adjustment functions.
  8- r1: contains functions related to r1@iit.
  9- rectify: contains rectification related functions.
 10- test: constains multiple-views geometry functions (as explained by Hartley and Zisserman).
